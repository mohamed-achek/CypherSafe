File Encryption, Decryption & Hashing Tool
Welcome to the File Encryption, Decryption, and Hashing Tool — a simple yet powerful Python-based application for securing your files through modern cryptography and data integrity verification.

🚀 Features
🔒 Encrypt Files using strong symmetric encryption (AES via Fernet).

🔓 Decrypt Files easily with the correct key.

🔎 Hash Files using various algorithms (SHA-256, MD5, etc.) to verify data integrity.

📂 Save encrypted files, decrypted outputs, and hash values safely.

🛡️ Secure Key Management (keys are stored securely and separately).

🖥️ Simple User Interface (CLI, optional GUI with Tkinter coming soon).


🔐 Security Notes
Keys are generated per encryption session and stored separately.

Keep your keys safe! Losing a key means losing the ability to decrypt files.

The tool uses Fernet symmetric encryption, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.

Always verify hashes after transferring critical files.


🧟️ Future Improvements
🎨 Add a full Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Tkinter.

⚙️ Support for batch processing of multiple files at once.

📬 Option to email encryption keys securely.

🗃️ Compress and encrypt entire folders.

📈 Add a progress bar for large file encryption.

⏳ Implement key expiration and regeneration mechanisms.
